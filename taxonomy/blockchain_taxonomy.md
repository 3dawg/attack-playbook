>Attack Taxonomy for general blockchain vulnerabilities.

- **Types of Consensus Mechanism Attacks**

  - *51% Attack*
     - The 51%-Attack is an attack on the consensus algorithm of a blockchain application. The
        hacker attempts to take over the network by controlling most of the nodes in said network, or more than 50%
        of the total computation power in the network.
     - This can overthrow the main consensus algorithim and allow otherwise valid blocks from being added to the chain or add malicious ones.
