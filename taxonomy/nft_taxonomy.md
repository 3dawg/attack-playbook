-   Spoof NFT Website Scam
    -   * Scammers create flash mint websites to mimic official NFT project websites. Most websites are obvious to experienced NFT collectors but other more sophofisticated spoof websites are so professionally created they can pass under the noses of NFT experts.
    -   *

-   Phishing Attack
    -   * Scammers send malicious direct messages and pop-ups through spoof websites asking for users' private wallet keys or 12-word or 24-word seed phrases. Once a scammer has access to the users private keys, the ownership of the tokens resting on the compromised wallet now belong to the scammer.
    -   *

-   Stealth Mint
    -   * A fake minting scheme to draw attention from NFT interests in the attempt to lowing to mint a fake or 0 NFTs in exchange for money. Scammers send malicious direct messages via social media platforms such as Discord, Twitter, Instagram, and more to trick NFT collectors into purchasing these illegitimate NFTs. 
    -   *
-   Supply Chain Attacks
    -    * An attack that relies upon malicous or vulnerable code and uses the trust of third party code. This can affect software and hardware wallets. 

-  Man in The Middle Attack
    -    * An attack in which the attacker attempts to intercept comunications between the user and browser. This can be used to intercept a wallet private key and steal NFTS if traffic is not properly encrypted.

-  Token ID Spoofing
    -    * Scammers can trick users into buying a fake NFT by spoofing the unique token ID of said NFT. These NFTS can look the exact same as the original and will typically lead to the victim paying exorbitant amounts of money for the fake NFT.

-   Blockchain Reorganization Attacks
    -    * A blockchain reorganization typically occurs when one or more blocks is replaced by a new version. This new version has to be under the longest chain rule. The chain may not contain the same set of transactions as the old chain. Meaning that any old NFT transactions could be removed resulting in a delay on the ledger. Which could be used to hide front running.

-   Front Running Attacks
    -  * An attack in which the attacker will examine the memory pool where unconfirmed transactions lay. Then they will pay to have their transaction moved up, therefore passing any unconfimed transactions.
