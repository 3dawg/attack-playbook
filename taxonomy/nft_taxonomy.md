-   Spoof NFT Website Scam
    -   * Scammers create flash mint websites to mimic official NFT project websites. Most websites are obvious to experienced NFT collectors but other more sophofisticated spoof websites are so professionally created they can pass under the noses of NFT experts.
    -   * Typically this happens through social media sites such as X(Twitter). These are known as fake airdrops and can lead to a wallet drainer.

-   Phishing Attack
    -   * Scammers send malicious direct messages and pop-ups through spoof websites asking for users' private wallet keys or 12-word or 24-word seed phrases. Once a scammer has access to the users private keys, the ownership of the tokens resting on the compromised wallet now belong to the scammer.

-   Man in the Middle attacks 
    -   * A man in the middle attack will typically occur when an attacker intercepts the comunications between the target and network service. Most commonly it is used to intercept unecrypted traffic from trusted blockchain sites and steal a users private key.

-  Front Running Attacks
    -   * Front running happens when an attacker looks at the mempool of public unconfirmed transactions. From there they will pay to add a competing tranaction to the top of the list of unconfirmed transactions, therefore disrupting the transaction process.

- Blockchain Reorganization Attacks
    -    * A blockchain reorginzation can happen when a confirmed block is replaced by a new one under the longest chain rule. This new block cannot contain the same transactions, so often an NFT can be removed from the ledger. Disrupting the chain and NFT sales.

- Token ID Spoofing
    -    * Token spoofing will typically happen when the unique Token ID of an NFT is spoofed in order to trick a target into buying a fake NFT. This will often lead to the fake NFT being priced higher in order to squeeze out more money from the victim.
