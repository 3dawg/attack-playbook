# Attack Playbook

### Introduction

The attack playbook is a compendium of relevant hacks, scams, exploits, and general cyberattacks that occur on Web3 products. We have generalized these events, whether it be cyber or real-world, to be specified as <b> attacks</b>, regardless of architectural nature. An "attack" is a general cybersecurity term to describe an event of a breech on a digital product or platform. Adversarial attacks on ML models such as BERT, GRU, ERNIE, LSTM, RoBERTa, RNNs, GPT-3, and more. "De-adversarial" attacks occur on blockchain-based products with a partial-full decentralized architecture, these include cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DeFi protocols, and digital asset platforms.

Sena Labs promotes the DYOR "do your own research" model, as the primary requirement to explore digital assets powered by blockchain; studying the architecture and methodology of attacks within the digital asset arena is strongly recommended. 

The "DYOR" model incentivizes users to research relevant risk factors as they invest. We hope that this attack playbook informs users of the risk landscape associate with Web3. Inevitable headaches are the product of information overload that comes from learning about the attacks that occur on digital assets while also learning about the BASICS of the space.

Types of digital assets explored in our Sena Exploratory Attack Library(SEAL):
- Bitcoin
- Cryptocurrencies
- DeFi tokens
- NFTs
- Digital Land
- NFT Gaming
- Metaverse items

Running DeFi dichotomy from Sena Labs:
> All DeFi tokens are cryptocurrencies, but not all cryptocurrencies are DeFi tokens.

Defintions:
1. What is Bitcoin?
> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that allows for electronic payments. Bitcoin was launched by anonymous super-coder, Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

2. What are cryptocurrencies?
> Any digital currency whose transacations are stored on a blockchain and is not Bitcoin. 
> Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that represent value on the blockchain:
>- Payment Tokens
>- Contract Tokens
>- Currency Tokens
>- Brand Tokens
>- Non-fungible Tokens
>- Asset Tokens
>- Metaverse Tokens
>- Platform Tokens 
>- Utility Tokens
>- Meme coins
>- Stablecoins
>- Security Tokens

3. What is DeFi?
> DeFi is decentralized finance, an industry created by the collection of traditional finance services that are decentralized using DApps (decentralized applications).

4.  What's an NFT?
> An NFT is a "non-fungible" token, a digital asset that is unique in its existence and stored on a blockchain. NFTs can be considered digital art, digital land, or any item digitized and minted on a blockchain such as Ethereum, Polygon, Celo, and more.

5. What is Digital Land?
> Digital land are virtual plots of land sold in the metaverse for gaming, investing, projects and other purposes.
> Top Digital Land Platforms:
>- Sandbox
>- Spatial
>- Cryptovoxels
>- Decentraland
>- ULAND
>- OVR
>- SuperWorld
>- Next Earth
>- Pavia

6. What is the Metaverse?
> Virtual world epicenters where avatars can meet up, play games, collaborate, socialize, and more.
