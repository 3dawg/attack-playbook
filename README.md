# Sena Hack Library

Sena Labs has created a hack library that lists relevant hacks, exploits, and compromises that occur in the cryptocurrency community.

Types of digital assets explored in our Hack Library. The need to study the architecture of methodology of hacks in the digital asset arena is up to the user. At Sena Labs we support a DYOR model that incentivizes users to DYOR as you invest in HODL. We hope this Hack Library saves users evitable headaches that come the digital asset arena:

- Bitcoin
- Cryptocurrencies (non-DeFi)
- DeFi tokens
- NFTs & Digital Land

Running dichotomy from Sena Labs:
> All DeFi tokens are cryptocurrencies, but not all cryptocurrencies are DeFi.
