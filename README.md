# Sena Hack Library

Sena Labs has created a hack library that lists relevant hacks, scams, exploits, and compromises that occur in the cryptocurrency community. We have generalized these events, whether cyber or real-world to be "attacks", regardless of technical nature.

The imperative need to study the architecture and methodology of attacks within the digital asset arena is up to the user. At Sena Labs we support a DYOR model that incentivizes users to DYOR as you invest and HODL. We hope this Hack Library saves users evitable headaches that emerges in the digital asset arena.

Types of digital assets explored in our Hack Library:
- Bitcoin
- Cryptocurrencies (non-DeFi)
- DeFi tokens
- NFTs
- Digital Land

Running dichotomy from Sena Labs:
> All DeFi tokens are cryptocurrencies, but not all cryptocurrencies are DeFi tokens.
