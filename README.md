# Attack Playbook

### Introduction
Sena Labs has supplied an attack playbook that lists relevant hacks, scams, exploits, and general attacks that occur on Web3 products. We have generalized these events, whether it be cyber or real-world, to be specified as <b> attacks</b>, regardless of architectural nature. An "attack" is a general cybersecurity term to describe an event of a breech on a digital product or platform. Adversarial attacks occur on AI/ML products such as ML models. 

Sena Labs promotes the DYOR "do your own research" model, as the primary requirement to explore digital assets powered by blockchain; studying the architecture and methodology of attacks within the digital asset arena is strongly recommended. 

The "DYOR" model incentivizes users to research relevant risk factors as they invest. We hope that this attack playbook informs users of the risk landscape associate with Web3. Inevitable headaches are the product of information overload that comes from learning about the attacks that occur on digital assets while also learning about the BASICS of the space.

Types of digital assets explored in our Sena Exploratory Attack Library(SEAL):
- Bitcoin
- Cryptocurrencies
- DeFi tokens
- NFTs
- Digital Land
- NFT Gaming
- Metaverse items

Running DeFi dichotomy from Sena Labs:
> All DeFi tokens are cryptocurrencies, but not all cryptocurrencies are DeFi tokens.

Defintions:

3. What is DeFi?
> DeFi is decentralized finance, an industry created by the collection of traditional finance services that are decentralized using DApps (decentralized applications).

4.  What's an NFT?
> An NFT is a "non-fungible" token, a digital asset that is unique in its existence and stored on a blockchain. NFTs can be considered digital art, digital land, or any item digitized and minted on a blockchain such as Ethereum, Polygon, Celo, and more.

> Digital land are virtual plots of land sold in the metaverse for gaming, investing, projects and other purposes.
> Top Digital Land Platforms:
>- Sandbox
>- Cryptovoxels
>- Decentraland
>- ULAND
>- OVR
>- SuperWorld
